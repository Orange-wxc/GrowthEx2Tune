Start the process using the command below:\n\n```bash\npython main.py\n```\n\n## **Other Notes**\n- **EKC Rules:** You can customise your own labels and rules in \n`maEnv/datautils.py/status_to_labels` and `maEnv/datautils.py/node_labels_to_action_trend`.\n- **Hyperparameters:** In order to get a good effect of tuning, you should you should adjust the hyperparameters in `tune/train_wxc.py` appropriately.\n"
